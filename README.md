# Weaving-Instructions-Generator
This project explores the relationship between the simple geometrical patterns that one can make in cloth
woven on these looms, and the complexity of the loom. The looms that are used to teach weaving and then produce woven goods are
manually operated, using a combination of hand and foot movements after the loomâ€™s threading has
been performed. Our program takes as input a pattern drawn graphically, convert it into a language from
which we can generate a set of instructions that we can give to weavers in a spoken form.

Graphical language for describing patterns
Calculating the minimum harnesses needed for our loom to produce the given pattern
Implementation of our N-Harness loom
Output instructions(which pedal(s) to press) for weaver to produce the pattern through speech
